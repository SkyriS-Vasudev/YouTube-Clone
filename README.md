<Strong>About</Strong>
 <br>
  This is a simple YouTube homepage clone created using only HTML and CSS . The project focuses on replicating the layout and styling of YouTube’s interface, helping me practice core web development skills such     as structuring a webpage, working with flexbox, and applying responsive design principles.
